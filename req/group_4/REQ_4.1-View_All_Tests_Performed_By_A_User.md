# History and Hall of Fame

# Use case 1 
*   As a user I want a list that displays all tests performed by a specific user.

## Primary actor: User
## Level: User goal

## Prerequisites
* The user must be registered and logged in to access History & Hall of Fame

## Success Guarantee
* Any user must be able to view a list that displays all tests performed by a specific user.

## Happy Path
*   1. Whenever the user reaches History & Hall of Fame a list with all the users is displayed
*   2. a) The user inserts the name/email of one user in the search bar above the list and clicks the history button of that user
*   2. b) The user clicks the history button of a specific user 
*   3. All tests taken by that user are displayed

## Extensions or Alternative Paths
1. 
*   There are no registered users or tests
*   A message is displayed informing there are no users or tests

2. 
*   The user inserted doesn't exist
*   A message is displayed informing the user inserted doesn't exist

3. 
*   The user inserted is yet to take a test
*   A message is displayed informing the user inserted hasn't taken any tests
